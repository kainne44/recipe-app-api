# Tutorial Notes
# Test driven development ensures that the test works as intended before
# implementing the main program, ensuring the validity of the test itself.
# Before you write code, you must think about how to test it

# Note: To utilize Django's test framework,
# The test file/module must begin with 'test', and each of the methods
# or functions in the module must begin with test, as well
